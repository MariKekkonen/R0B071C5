Python codes for Lego EV3 robot

Python codes named as alku.py, labyrintti.py, koura.py and robonliike.py were created during Robot Uprising 2018 hackathon in Helsinki Finland (https://robotuprising.fi/). As a word of warning, because hackathons tend to be quite hectic events, all four codes are written in a hurry and all comments are in Finnish. In addition, they are mostly custom made for our Killer Rabbit bot and designed for the RU 2018 competition.

However, I'm quite pleased with the function called turn90 (in labyrintti.py), which is designed for making the robot follow a white line on a gray floor (the name 'turn90' is really unfit, but time was short..). Our Killer Rabbit had two LEGO EV3 color sensors so the code is naturally designed for two sensors. The code worked really well in the competition, but it has one downside; for some reason, it sometimes made the robot turn towards dark corners (I didn't have time to solve the problem during the hackathon).
I'm planning to improve the code as soon I get two color sensors to my own EV3 '3EV3RTT1' (only one color sensor comes with the robot in both educational and home editions).
